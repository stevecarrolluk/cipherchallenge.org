OVER THE YEARS THE HEROIC ROLE OF AGRICOLA AT WATLING STREET CAME TO THE NOTICE OF ROME AND TWO DECADES LATER HE WAS APPOINTED PRO CONSUL AND GOVERNOR OF BRITANNIA BY EMPEROR VESPASIAN. A FEW YEARS AFTER HIS APPOINTMENT VESPASIAN’S SON, DOMITIAN, BECAME EMPEROR, AND ONE OF HIS FIRST ACTS WAS TO ISSUE THE ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW IMPERIAL CIPHERS INVENTED BY THE CIPHER SCHOOL.

IN THE INTERVENING YEARS THE NINTH HAD BEEN LEFT TO FIGHT LONELY SKIRMISHES AND BATTLES FROM THEIR BASE AT EBORACUM. WITH FORTITUDE AND RESOLVE THEY REPEATEDLY DROVE THE BARBARIANS BACK INTO THE COLD HEARTLANDS OF CALEDONIA. DURING ONE SUCH SKIRMISH VARUS WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED AND AGRICOLA PROMOTED THE TRIBUNE MARCUS FIDELIUS CATO TO THE LEGATUS OF THE NINTH.

ONE DAY THE LUCK OF THE NINTH SEEMED TO CHANGE. A RECONNAISSANCE SQUAD REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SEEN THE AQUILA FLYING FROM A TREE AT MONS GRAUPIUS, IN A CAMP RULED BY A TRIBESMAN CALLED CALGACUS. THE NEW LEGATUS RECOGNISED THAT THE PRIVATIONS OF A LONG MARCH HAD EXHAUSTED HIS MEN, THEY WERE NOT READY FOR BATTLE AND CATO SHOULD HAVE SENT FOR REINFORCEMENTS, BUT THE JOY OF SEEING THE LOST AQUILA SO CLOSE AT HAND CLOUDED HIS JUDGEMENT, AND HE LAUNCHED AN ATTACK UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS.

FIGHTING UPHILL AGAINST WAVE UPON WAVE OF BARBARIANS, THE LEGION’S HEROIC EFFORTS WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE SUN RISING TO BLIND THEM AS DAWN BROKE. THE TROOPS IN THE FRONT LINE GAVE WAY WITH EXHAUSTION AND THE WILD CALGACUS DASHED OUT OF THE SUN DOWN THE BLOOD-SOAKED SLOPE WITH HIS CAVALRY INTO THE HEART OF THE LEGION. THE LEGION RAINED FLAMING ARROWS UPON THE ENEMY AND MANAGED TO UNHORSE CALGACUS TAKING HIM PRISONER, BUT COULD MAKE NO HEADWAY AGAINST THE SAVAGE HORDES AND WERE UNABLE TO REACH THE STOLEN AQUILA. WORSE WAS TO COME.

WHILE CATO ORGANISED A RETREAT WITH THE PRISONER CALGACUS IN CHAINS, THE REMAINING SOLDIERS HELD THE LINE AGAINST REPEATED CHARGES BY CALEDONIAN AND ICENIAN TRIBESMEN. WHEN THE LINE FINALLY BROKE, CATO AND MANY OF THE NINTH LEGION HAD REACHED SAFETY AND TOOK STOCK. THE CAVALRY WERE SAFE, AS WERE MANY OF THE BRAVE LEGIONNAIRES, BUT TO HIS HORROR, CATO REALISED THAT IN THE BATTLE HE HAD LOST THE SECOND AQUILA, AND WORSE, THE LEGION’S COPY OF THE CODEX HAD ALSO GONE.

THE DOCUMENTS LEFT TO ME BY AGRICOLA ARE UNCLEAR ON THIS POINT. DID HE KNOW THAT THE CODEX MIGHT HAVE FALLEN INTO ENEMY HANDS AND THAT A SECOND AQUILA HAD BEEN LOST? OR DID CATO ASSURE HIM THAT THE CODEX HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS PART OF AN ORDERLY RETREAT? PERHAPS CATO WAS YET TO RE-JOIN AGRICOLA AT THE FORT, AND COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE BATTLE HAD YET TO REACH HIM. IN A LETTER TO EMPEROR DOMITIAN, AGRICOLA WROTE “MOST EXCELLENT EMPEROR, AS YOU HAVE MOST GRACIOUSLY REQUESTED I HAVE FINISHED MY AFFAIRS HERE IN BRITANNIA IN PREPARATION FOR RETURNING TO YOUR SIDE IN ROME. IT PLEASES ME TO REPORT TO YOU THAT BY ACTS OF DIPLOMACY AND STRENGTH I HAVE PERSUADED THE NORTHERN REBELS TO YIELD TO OUR ARMY AND TO TURN OVER TO US THE REBEL CALGACUS WHO HAS REMAINED FREE SINCE THE WARS AGAINST BOUDICCA AND THE ICENI.” HIS LETTER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A REPLY TO NEW ORDERS FROM ROME IN WHICH DOMITIAN WROTE “MY ESTEEMED GNAEUS, UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR MOST RECENT LETTER I HAVE BEEN MOST TROUBLED. IT APPEARS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE SITUATION IN BRITANNIA HAS WORSENED AND SO I MUST ASK YOU TO RETURN TO ME AT ROME WITH THE UTMOST SPEED. CONDUCT YOUR REMAINING AFFAIRS IN THE PROVINCE AND DO NOT UNDERTAKE ANY ACTION WHICH MAY ENFLAME THE CURRENT TENSIONS BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE CALEDONII.” THE FINAL LINE OF THE EMPEROR’S LETTER SET A DEADLINE FOR AGRICOLA’S RETURN, “I SHALL EXPECT YOU TO HAVE CROSSED THE RUBICON BY THE END OF THE YEAR”, AND PERHAPS HE FELT THAT CONTRITION WAS A SAFER REFUGE.
WHATEVER AGRICOLA KNEW AT THAT POINT, WITHIN A MONTH HIS WORLD HAD BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN, AS FURTHER REPORTS FROM CALEDONIA MADE CLEAR THAT HIS HOPE OF RESTORATION IN THE EYES OF THE EMPEROR WERE IN REAL JEOPARDY. HE SET OUT TO RECOVER THE TWO AQUILAE AND TO DETERMINE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE CODEX BEFORE RETURNING TO ROME.

THOSE WHO READ ON MUST SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH IN THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF THE AMAZONS.
