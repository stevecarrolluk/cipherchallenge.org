In his Journal dated the Ides of October in the year of the consulships of Caecelius Tullius Capito Pomponianus Plotius Firmus and Gaius Cornelius Gallicanus, Agricola wrote “The mystery of the battle at Camulodonum is at last solved. Calgacus may be a Barbarian now, but he was a Roman citizen then, who betrayed us all for love of a barbarian. It has taken all my skills as a leader of men to keep him alive. The Legionnaires spend their evenings designing new and cruel ways to execute him in revenge for the shame he brought upon us, but his life is precious. It is the only card left to play in our search for salvation and the return of the stolen Aquilae. If we can also recover the Codex then perhaps its loss can be concealed and our lives will be spared.” Releasing the Roman traitor Calgacus must have stuck in the proud Agricola’s throat, but he made a pact with the remaining Caledonii and travelled north to exchange the prisoner for the Aquilae and the Codex. But the cunning Caledonian tribesman set another trap and presented Agricola with a forgery cunningly assembled with pages from the books stolen when the tribe ransacked Mons Graupius. For too long the sons of Rome had underestimated the people in Britannia and while the Aquila of the Legion had been restored by the exchange, their honour was not. Agricola faced a return to Rome, humiliation and almost certain death. The sixth chapter of my tale of woe is guarded by lightning, bull and oak.
