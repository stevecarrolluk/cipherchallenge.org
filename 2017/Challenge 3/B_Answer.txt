WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT SUETONIUS SET UP THE FINAL BATTLE WITH BOUDICCA AT WATLING STREET, HE HAD NEITHER THE TROOPS NOR THE TACTICAL ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE HUGE NUMERICAL DISADVANTAGE FACED BY HIS ARMY. WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF AGRICOLA AND HIS TALENTED SCOUTS, DEFEAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INEVITABLE, AND WITH IT THE LOSS OF BRITANNIA. HAVING REALISED THAT THE ICENI WERE READING HIS COMMUNICATIONS, AGRICOLA ARRANGED TO PLANT FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANNED DISPOSITION OF TROOPS, SETTING A TRAP INTO WHICH THE ICENI FELL. IT IS STILL UNCLEAR HOW THE SAVAGE TRIBES HAD LEARNED TO DECIPHER OUR ARMY'S COMMUNICATIONS, AS THEY HAD NO WRITING OF THEIR OWN. HOWEVER, EVERY ARMY HAS ITS TRAITORS, AND IT SEEMS LIKELY TO ME THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE LOCAL TRIBESPEOPLE TURNED SOMEONE'S HEAD - LOVE OR MONEY, IT IS ALL TREACHERY. BUT THIS ACT THREATENED TO UNDERMINE THE EMPIRE'S ENTIRE SYSTEM OF SECURE COMMUNICATION. THE CAESAR CIPHER, PERHAPS MORE THAN ROADS, HAD ENABLED THE EMPIRE TO FUNCTION SECURELY AND ITS LOSS WAS A DISASTER. TURNING THAT LOSS INTO A VICTORY ON THE BATTLEFIELD DESERVED MORE RECOGNITION THAN IT RECEIVED. PERHAPS SUETONIUS NEVER KNEW, OR PERHAPS HE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THE CUNNING OF THE PLAN, BUT EITHER WAY DESPITE THE VICTORY AGRICOLA AND THE NINTH LEGION REMAINED IN DISGRACE. ON HEARING THIS NEWS, CLAUDIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS GERMANICUS NERO, EMPEROR, ISSUED A SECRET PROCLAMATION ESTABLISHING A CIPHER SCHOOL TO DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM OF IMPERIAL CIPHERS. IT WORKED IN SECRET FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, DEVELOPING NEW METHODS TO SECURE COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS THE EMPIRE.
STUDYING THE WORKS OF THE GREEK SAGES, EUCLID AND HYPATIA, AND EVEN OLDER WORKS FROM ANCIENT BABYLON, THE SCHOOL DEVELOPED NEW WAYS TO SAFEGUARD COMMUNICATIONS FROM ROME'S ENEMIES. THESE NEW SYSTEMS WERE WRITTEN DOWN AND DISTRIBUTED IN THE CODEX OCCULTORUM, PERHAPS THE MOST STRICTLY GUARDED DOCUMENT IN ALL HISTORY. WHEN IT WAS FINALLY COMPLETED MANY YEARS LATER, THE EMPEROR DOMITIAN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH PREFACED EVERY COPY OF THE CODEX, THAT IT WAS TO BE GUARDED BY EVERY LEGION TO THE LAST MAN. THE DEFEAT OF THE ICENI AND THE SUICIDE OF BOUDICCA PERHAPS PROTECTED THE NINTH LEGION FROM DISSOLUTION. AGRICOLA WAS LARGELY LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES IN THE PROVINCE, THOUGH IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO HIM THAT TO RETURN WOULD MEAN AT BEST DISGRACE, AND AT WORST DEATH. IN A BREAK WITH TRADITION, THE NINTH RAISED A NEW STANDARD - THE LEGION WAS EXILED IN DISGRACE TO ENDURE THE HARD AND DANGEROUS WORK OF SUBDUING THE CALEDONII IN THE BLEAK WILDERNESSES OF CALEDONIA. SUETONIUS ORDERED THE NINTH TO MARCH TO EBORACUM, WHICH THEY WERE TO MAKE THEIR BASE FOR RAIDS INTO CALEDONIA. THE UNSPOKEN REASON FOR THEIR EXILE WAS THAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS WHERE THEY MIGHT FIND THEIR LOST AQUILA. THOSE WHO WOULD READ ON MUST FOLLOW MY FAITHFUL SLAVE TIRO, WHO FACES A GRAVE TASK - PERHAPS THE LARGEST TO DATE, AS HE TRAVELS TO CONCEAL THE FOURTH CHAPTER OF THIS TRAGIC TALE.
